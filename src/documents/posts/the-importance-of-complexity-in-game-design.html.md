### From the perspective of one independent game developer

_______________________________________________________________________________

 A few years ago, I began to work seriously on my first independent game.  I had grand ideas about producing a *high quality* (as I saw it at the time) game, with layers upon layers of complex interactions and objectives.  Despite the fact that I was working ten to twelve hours a day, I convinced myself that if I was going to make something, it was going to be something *worthwhile*, something that I could be *proud of*.

 After months of short, after-work sessions, I had built up the infrastructure that would support the complex, varied interactions between the many components and the player, and I was ready to *begin* implementing the interactions themselves. After several more months, the first few interactions basically worked, but I had begun to realize my mistake. I had committed to a scope that did not match my constraints.  However, based on the assumption that it made more sense to continue than to begin again, I pressed on.  For many more months, I filled my free time with the ground work necessary to get my game just barely functional.  As I got more pieces of the prototype functional, I felt more sure that I had made the right choice after all.  My friends and family looked on in puzzlement when I handed them the prototype.  However, rather than take this for the sign it was, I frantically tried to give context for the varied and disparate components and interactions.  Eventually, the pieces did begin to fit together into a cohesive whole, and my conviction grew.

As I improved my skills, the speed of development increased.  Before long, I was able to add each feature very rapidly and move on to the next.  I became obsessed with completing pieces of functionality, and the quality of the interface and the experience suffered. Once I had worked on the game full time for nearly half a year, I had most of the planned features functional.  I was on the verge of releasing a product of terrible quality (the opposite of my original goal, you may recall) because I had convinced myself that a robust feature set could replace a polished, refined experience.

Then, a friend whose opinion I value very highly began to give me input on the game. His turned out to be the voice of reason I needed to hear in order to step back and see the big picture.  I began to realize that many of the features added only complexity rather than value.  I had built something technically impressive, but not particularly enjoyable.  I decided it was time to take a break from the project and try something new.

I took one feature I was very fond of from a previous project and decided to make a whole game around it.  I did only the minimum work and made it playable as quickly as possible.  Over the course of one weekend, I built a tiny, bite-sized game infinitely more enjoyable than the one I had spent two years building to monolithic proportions.

### The moral of the story

___

- Don’t fool yourself into thinking you won’t be taken seriously unless your game has some arbitrary level of complexity.  If you take one interaction or feature and do it very well, you will produce a much more enjoyable experience.
- Don’t travel a great distance down any one design path until you have validated your assumptions.  Prototype rapidly, test each feature, and judge quickly whether it actually adds to your core experience.  If a feature distracts from the experience, remove it.
