## From the perspective of one independent game developer

_______________________________________________________________________________

 A few years ago, I began to work seriously on my first independent game.  I convinced myself that if I wanted to make a name for myself as an independent game developer, my very first app needed to stand out.  I knew my app would need to be high-quality to stand out, and to me, that meant it needed to be complex.  I selected a game that my friends and family had been enjoying, and which had been successful on the app store charts, and decided to add a twist of my own to the basic concept.  Despite the fact that I was working ten to twelve hours a day, I committed to a scope that would have been ambitious for an experienced game studio. After months of short, after-work sessions, I had built up the infrastructure that would support the complex, varied interactions between the many components and the player. Soon, the first few interactions basically worked, but I had begun to realize my mistake. My scope that did not match my constraints.  However, out of reluctance to lose all my work and begin again, I pressed on.  I filled my free time with the ground work necessary to get my game just barely functional.  As I got more pieces of the prototype functional, I felt more sure that I had made the right choice after all.  

As I improved my skills, the speed of development increased.  Before long, I was able to add each feature very rapidly and move on to the next.  I became obsessed with completing pieces of functionality, and the quality of the interface and the experience suffered. My friends and family looked on in puzzlement when I handed them the prototype, frantically trying to provide context for the varied and disparate components.  Once I had worked on the game full time for nearly half a year, I had most of the planned features functional.  I was on the verge of releasing a product of terrible quality because I had convinced myself that a robust feature set could replace a polished, refined experience. Then, a friend began to give me input on the game. His turned out to be the voice of reason I needed to hear in order to step back and see the big picture.  I began to realize that many of the features added only complexity rather than value.  I decided it was time to take a break from the project and try something new.

I took one feature I was very fond of from a previous project and decided to make a whole game around it.  I did only the minimum work and made it playable as quickly as possible.  Over the course of one weekend, I built a tiny, bite-sized game much more enjoyable than the one I had spent two years building to monolithic proportions.  Flush with that success, I decided to dedicate myself fully to the new project.  Furthermore, I promised myself I wouldn't let the pure, simple joy of the core experience be diluted by complexity creep. 

I've been working on the new project for nearly half a year, and each time I've experimented with adding a feature, my testers have complained that they liked an earlier version better.  With their help, I've kept the experience lean and enjoyable, and I'm nearly ready to release the game.  I hope that other aspiring independent game developers can learn from my example what it took me years to learn the hard way - that a game does not have to be complex to be an enjoyable, quality experience.


## What I learned

___

- If a feature does not add to the core experience, it distracts from and dilutes the core experience.
- Donâ€™t travel a great distance down any one design path until you have validated your assumptions.  Prototype rapidly, and get user feedback often.
